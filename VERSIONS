freecelljsolver 

VERSION 1.3.2
- Realizing that the Freecell solution "standard notation" has a limitation, that it cannot specify the number of cards moving to an empty column.
  To prevent this ambiguity, added a command line option to output a notation of number of cards following the move.
- Making it easier to print out each boards between moves, by moving the option from the properties file to a command line option. 

VERSION 1.3.1
- BUG FIX: after reading in a board, normalize it so that it can be processed correctly ( -b option ).
- ENHANCEMENT: enable the read board function to handle lower case suit representation ( -b option ).

VERSION 1.3.0
- implemented board revision based system to prevent unnecessary moves, e.g. moving a card from a column and to a free cell, and move it to another column immediately after. It mimics human player by reasoning, "why would I move this card to there? I have already decided not to move it there earlier, and nothing has happened since then." It improves the result on majority of the deals; This is disabled by default, and can be activated by option "--useBoardRevisions".

VERSION 1.2.0
- now it prints standard move notations
- quite a few improvements, both in simplicity and performance
- the Berkeley DB backed should work well now 
- added random depth first scan

version 1.1.0
- added parallel dual solver mode (see tests/dual for example). This mode dramatically improves performance on a good multi-processor machine.
- added capability to choose number of free cells and columns.
- reduced object creations/deletions to lessen the load on java's garbage collector, which is a performance bottle neck when search space gets large.
- on a mid range dual processor machine, in dual mode, with 1024M (dual mode requires more memory) heap space, the solver is able to solve the first million deals in about 6 hours. The median time for solving a deal is about 50 milliseconds. 

version 1.0.1
- added VERSION_STRING to FreecellSolver class to note the version
- added Berkeley DB backed boards option; Though preliminary testing shows it works, this is EXPERIMENTAL! 

version 1.0.0
- initial source code release under GPL;
